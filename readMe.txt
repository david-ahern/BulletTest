I have set up a simple simulation, and the .exe in the Debug folder should run it without having to compile through visual studio.
Here are the key controls:-
r - Reset
space - Fire ball at wall
b, n, m, j, k - Drop various primitives from point 0, 10, 0
Left Mouse - Rotate camera
Right mouse - Move camera look at (isnt perfect)
z, x - Zoom in and out.
